# MERN
This project is based on the DevConnector from Brad Traversy's Udemy course "MERN Stack Front to Back: Full Stack React, Redux &amp; Node.js"

I changed the purpose of this project from being a social media app for software developers to connect and collaborate to a social media app for people in the entertainment industry to get together, collaborate, and get work.

Instead of using the premade stying as it was for the DevConnector project, I used React Icons and changed the colors and background image for the landing page to better suit an entertainment industry-themed app.

Currently users can log in and create profiles. This is a work in progess - currently debugging posts and authentication. I learned a lot from the course this was based on, but many things in it became deprecated before I did the course, so adjustments must be made.
